/*
* The storage of the stage2_params variable during memory initialization
* involves several changes of locations. Initially, before memory becomes
* available, it is stored inside the Cache-As-RAM, more precisely as the stack
* variable `temp_params` in `boot_x86_fsp.c:start()`. Once memory initialization
* occurs in stage1, the stage2_params is copied into memory. In stage2, when
* writable data sections are available, stage2_params resides in the .data
* section.
*
* The function `stage2_get_parameters()` is utilized throughout the code to
* obtain the correct address of stage2_params. It's important to note that
* whenever the location changes, the structure is copied verbatim. References to
* the struct must be updated manually. Additionally, during the transition to
* stage2, all references to function pointers will not be valid anymore.
*
* Internals:
* During stage1, the pointer to the parameter is stored just before the IDT
* (Interrupt Descriptor Table) table, and it can be recovered using the sidt
* instruction. This necessitates the presence of a dummy table with a single
* NULL descriptor. In stage2, stage2_get_parameter() serves as a wrapper
* function that simply returns the address of the _stage2_parameter global
* variable.
