# Sample Application

Take a single, simple, stand-alone `blinky` example adapted from [wolfBoot/test-app](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfBoot/tree/master/test-app)
and document the steps needs to add wolfBoot as a secure bootloader.

See the sample `build.sh` - meant to be a stand-alone example, it downloads a local `wolfBoot` and submodules (wolfssl, wolfHSM, etc)

## Contents

- [app](./app) Directory
  - `include` some STM32 files copied from CubeIDE to build without install.
  - `main` blinky (or not, if wolfBoot disabled; uses wolfBoot LED files.)
  - `startup_stm32l4.c` barebones startup.
  - `target.h` generated from wolfBoot, but could be hand-crafted.

- [cmake](./cmake) directory; typical example cmake, separate from wolfBoot.
  - `stm32l4.ld` linker
  - `toolchain_arm-none-eabi.cmake` sample app toolchain, separate from wolfBoot.

- [build.sh](./build.sh) example usage.

- [CMakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt) - Application CMake, separate from wolfBoot.

- [CMakePresets.json](./CMakePresets.json) - Application CMake presets, separate from wolfBoot.
Shown for reference only. Note application build script is not using the presets that wolfBoot uses.
