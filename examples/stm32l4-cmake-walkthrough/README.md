# Sample Application

Take a single, simple, stand-alone `blinky` example from [wolfBoot/test-app](https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfBoot/tree/master/test-app)
and document the steps needs to add wolfBoot as a secure bootloader.


See the sample `build.sh` - meant to be a stand-alone example, it downloads a local `wolfBoot` and submodules (wolfssl, wolfHSM, etc)
